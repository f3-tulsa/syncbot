"""Ordered hard-delete helpers for syncs and workspaces.

``syncs`` -> ``sync_channels`` -> ``post_meta`` are plain foreign keys with no
``ON DELETE CASCADE``, so MySQL rejects a parent-first delete with error 1451.
Every hard delete in this module therefore removes children before parents.

Two properties matter to callers:

* **Not atomic.** Each :class:`~db.DbManager` call opens and commits its own
  session, so a failure part-way through leaves earlier deletes committed.
  Child-first ordering is what makes that safe — the worst case is a parent row
  with no children, which is harmless and cleaned up by re-running.
* **Idempotent.** Calling either function twice for the same id is a no-op the
  second time, so a retry after a partial failure always converges.

This module imports **submodules only** (``db``, ``db.schemas``,
``helpers._cache``) and never the ``helpers`` package, because
``helpers/__init__`` imports ``helpers.notifications`` (which calls
:func:`purge_workspace`) before ``helpers.workspace``. Importing the package
here would be a circular import at Lambda cold start.
